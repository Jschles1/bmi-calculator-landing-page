## Overview

### The challenge

- See their BMI result, with their weight classification and healthy weight range
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

This project did not really give me any new challenges that I haven't encountered before. I used this project mainly as a way to practice my skills with creating non-conventional responsive layouts.

### Continued development

I may look into using CSS grid instead of flexbox for future non-conventional responsive layouts.
